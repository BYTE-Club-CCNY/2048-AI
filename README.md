# 2048-AI

## Running 2048

I have copied over the source code for a simple 2048 game.
To run the game, make sure your python installation has TKinter support.

1. Navigate to the `game` directory.
2. Run `python main.py`.

## TODO

- Building model.py
- Making sure agent.py runs well with model.py after building model
- Testing and plotting data
- Fine-tuning variables in agent for better performance
- Implementing search algorithms so AI is able to discover best paths to achieve 2048 or higher

Feel free to add more to the README with any TODO's or documentation.
