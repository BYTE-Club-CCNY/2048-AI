# 2048-AI

## Running 2048

I have copied over the source code for a simple 2048 game. 
To run the game, make sure your python installation has TKinter support.

1. Navigate to the `game` directory.
2. Run `python main.py`.

## TODO
- Start implementing the AI
- Figure out a way to get the AI to play the game.

Feel free to add more to the README with any TODO's or documentation.
